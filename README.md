# JEDY
JVM (Java SE 8 Edition) implementation in Python3

## WHY
It's seems ridiculous a JVM run on Python, well, maybe it is.
But for me, it's for learn more about Python, and got more understand about Java, what is Java, why Java, and why not Java.
On the other hand, I don't think programing language is a problem. If I can implement JVM in Python, then I can implement JVM in any other program language.
The most important thing is, ridiculous always means fun ;)
